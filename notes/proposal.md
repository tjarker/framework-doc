Abstract:

The ever growing complexity of modern hardware designs necessitates robust verification methodologies to ensure correctness and reliability. The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) has become a widely adopted framework for hardware verification, providing a standardized environment for developing reusable and scalable testbenches in SystemVerilog. In addition to its support in commercial tools, open-source implementations of the UVM IEEE standard 1800.2 are also available in other languages, such as PyUVM in Python and E-UVM in the D language.
This thesis aims to critically examine the design principles underlying UVM, incorporating insights from industry experts to identify potential limitations. Based on this analysis and considering the features of a selected target language, the thesis will propose an adapted verification methodology. The feasibility of this new approach will be demonstrated through an initial implementation.
