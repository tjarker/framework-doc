My name is Tjark Petersen, and I am currently pursuing my master's thesis at DTU. For my thesis, I am investigating current practices and methodologies in the field of hardware verification with the aim of improving the verification process and prototyping a framework to showcase my results.

To ensure that my work is rooted in real-world challenges, it would be incredibly valuable for me to gain insights into how verification is currently done in the industry. What impedes the efficiency of the overall verification pipeline? But also, what pain points and needs may engineers working with verification on a daily basis encounter?

To this end, I would like to get in touch with [COMPANY] to discuss these questions and learn more about your current verification practices.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with your team.

Best regards,
Tjark

Hi Peter,

As I mentioned to your colleagues, I am investigating current practices and methodologies in the field of hardware verification as part of my master's thesis with the aim of improving the verification process and prototyping a framework to showcase my results.

Since SyoSil has a focus on verification, I think that it would be extremely valuable to talk to you and get to know your perspectives on what can be improved in the verification process.

I am available any of the upcoming Mondays and Fridays starting from next week. Please let me know which date works best for you.
