- which langauge features of SV are you using?
- does the TLM suit your needs or are there cases where it does not model the data well?
- what do you think of the dynamic reconfiguration part? i.e. uvm factory and db stuff
- how do you usually make the golden model? which language? how is it connected to scoreboard?
- Can you describe the usual process of verification? E.g. how is functional coverage matrix defined?
- what tools do you use in the verification process?
- how is verification affecting your design cycle? is it holding back?

### Understanding Current Verification Practices:
1. **What are the primary challenges you face in your current verification processes?**
2. **How do you currently structure your verification environment, and what tools or methodologies do you use?**
3. **Which aspects of the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) do you find most beneficial, and where does it fall short?**
4. **How often do you encounter issues related to the reusability and scalability of verification components across different projects?**

### Assessing Flexibility and Customization Needs:
5. **How important is flexibility in customizing verification environments to meet the specific requirements of different projects?**
6. **Do you require support for multiple languages (e.g., SystemVerilog, Python, D) in your verification framework? If so, how well does your current framework support this need?**
7. **What specific features or capabilities would you like to see in a verification methodology that would make it more adaptable to your needs?**

### Performance and Efficiency Considerations:
8. **How do you measure the efficiency and effectiveness of your verification efforts, and what improvements are you looking for?**
9. **Are there particular areas where your current verification approach is slowing down the design cycle?**

### Support and Integration:
10. **How critical is the integration of your verification framework with other tools (e.g., design tools, simulators, coverage tools)?**
11. **What level of support or ease of use do you require for debugging, reporting, and analysis within your verification framework?**

### Future Trends and Requirements:
12. **As designs become more complex, what new challenges do you foresee in verification, and how should a verification methodology evolve to address these?**
13. **Are there any emerging technologies (e.g., AI/ML-based verification, cloud-based verification) that you believe will impact your verification strategies in the near future?**
14. **What role do you see for open-source verification tools and frameworks in your future verification plans?**

### Validation of a New Approach:
15. **If a new verification methodology were proposed, what key features or capabilities would be essential for you to consider adopting it?**
16. **How important is industry-standard compliance (e.g., IEEE 1800.2) in your selection of a verification methodology?**
17. **What are the biggest risks or concerns you would have in transitioning to a new verification methodology?**

### UVM Adoption and Usage:
1. **How extensively do you use UVM in your verification processes? Is it the primary methodology, or do you use it alongside other approaches?**
2. **Which UVM components (e.g., `uvm_env`, `uvm_driver`, `uvm_scoreboard`) do you most frequently use, and which ones do you rarely or never use?**
3. **How do you handle the learning curve associated with UVM for new team members? Are there specific challenges they face?**

### Features and Capabilities:
4. **Which UVM features do you find most valuable (e.g., factory pattern, TLM, UVM sequences)? Why?**
5. **Are there any UVM features or components that you find cumbersome or overly complex? How do you manage these challenges?**
6. **Do you use UVMâ€™s register layer for register verification? If so, how effective is it in meeting your needs?**

### Customization and Flexibility:
7. **How much customization do you apply to UVM components and phases to tailor them to your specific verification needs?**
8. **Do you find the UVM configuration database flexible enough for your projects, or do you encounter limitations?**
9. **How well does UVM support the integration of your specific verification IPs (VIPs) and third-party components?**

### Unmet Needs and Challenges:
10. **What are the biggest limitations or pain points you experience with UVM in your verification processes?**
11. **Are there any verification tasks or scenarios where you find UVM insufficient or lacking in functionality?**
12. **Do you encounter any performance or efficiency issues when using UVM, particularly with large or complex designs?**

### Preferences and Desired Improvements:
13. **If you could change or improve one aspect of UVM, what would it be and why?**
14. **How important is the ability to easily debug and trace UVM-based verification issues? Does UVM meet your expectations in this area?**
15. **Do you prefer to use open-source UVM implementations, or do you rely solely on commercial tool support? Why?**

### Future Considerations:
16. **How do you see your usage of UVM evolving with the increasing complexity of designs?**
17. **Would you be interested in or open to adopting an adapted or enhanced version of UVM if it addressed your current unmet needs?**
18. **How important is it for UVM to support emerging verification techniques (e.g., formal verification, portable stimulus) within your workflow?**

### Validation and Feedback:
19. **Have you provided feedback to the UVM community or tool vendors regarding your experiences? If so, what was the nature of your feedback?**
20. **Would you participate in a pilot or beta testing of a new UVM feature or methodology if it promised to address your challenges?**
