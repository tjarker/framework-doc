- one of the things which seem a bit strange about UVM could be
  the configurability approach using the UVM factory
- Is this really the best way to achieve modularity and 
  interchangableness?
- and to me it seems like this way of reconfiguring testbenches
  is very messy. Do companies actually use it or avoid it?

Week 1 Summary (02.09.2024-06.09.2024)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This week I started off the project by reading a book on SystemVerilog (SV). I thought it was 
a good idea to understand the exact boundary between what is actually UVM and what is just 
part of SV as a language. 

Most of the language additions over Verilog concern verification and seem very well integrated 
with the language. This is a tough challenge for any non-SV verification framework and opens 
the question to how much should be integrated into a new verification framework and how much 
should be left to be described in SV (Amelia mentioned that people at SiFive are happy with 
writing their SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) on the SV generated by chisel). Should it only be 
the actual creation and driving of stimulus? Creating something like SVA and even coverage 
collection with the same ease of use as in SV is difficult, because these are described right next 
to the source code they are verifying which also means that internal signals are visible for coverage 
and assertions (how would one reference an internal signal in an SV blackbox when testing in a 
hypothetical Scala framework?).

I read a chapter on UVM in SV which did not reveal much new compared to the PyUVM book that 
I've read in June. I also used chipverify.com as a reference for more complex features of UVM.

In terms of companies which I would like to talk to, I have come up with this list:
- Syosil
- Microchip
- Oticon
- GN
- WS Audiology

I know who to talk to in Syosil and Microchip. Concerning the hearing aid companies, I do not 
have contact persons, but I know that for instance Jens does. I think 4 companies is a good start, 
so I would like to hear if you have any suggestions on who to talk to in which company.

I am figuring out the questions that I would like to ask these companies. Should I ask about very 
specific issues with certain UVM components or should I aim broader and ask about the general 
verification process and how the methodology behind UVM fits their needs? I think the latter is 
more interesting.

This week I will try to get my hands a bit dirty with UVM and verify a use-case. I will also start 
reaching out to the companies. 

How should we proceed in terms of meetings? Should we arrange a weekly slot in the evening?

@Martin, I hope you are enjoying sunny California!

Cheers,
Tjark

TODO:
  - write mail to Martin and Luca
  - create a simple UVM testbench (eda playground?)
  - read up how register abstraction is actually used

- one basic design choice of UVM is how to handle the concurrency of a testbench
- here TLM with queues is used as a means of communication between TB components
- this is very akin to a "hardware" approach to a testbench with different components
  which are "wired" together
- can this be done in a different maybe more ergonomic way?

- UVM seems like a deep rabbit-hole with way too many features
- things like Easier UVM actually try to restrict the use of UVM to a subset of features
- what is the best balance between maximum customizability and ease of use?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
  - [x] prepare message to companies describing the project and what I would like to talk about
  - [ ] get uvm running on eda1
  - [X] prepare for meeting with Martin and Luca
  - [ ] get a broad overview of software testing methods
  - [x] create Latex doc for thesis (or should I use typist?)
  - [ ] organize all the downloaded stuff

Martin Feedback:
  - it is only commercial tools implementing the SV features -> that makes it ok to provide the same functionality in a different language if you can avoid commercial tools
  - SVA can't be written into generated SV, but work is ongoing for writing SVA in Chisel
  - software testing methods could be an inspiration for verification
  - is accessing  internal signals in a tb possible?
    - not in SV but through the shell or DPI interface
    - DPI is possible in Verilator
  - I should do a presentation on the project in the chisel meeting monday 18:00

Meeting Agenda:
  - Visit to Berkely
    - When should I come to Berkeley and for how long?
    - What would I do there? Will I get a desk? How is Martins schedule?
  - Coverage:
    - I think it should be possible to do internal coverage, only doing it at the IO seems limiting
    - not only functional coverage but also code coverage (statement, branch, fsm)

Meeting Notes:
  - what should we do?
    - should we try to do something at the methodological level? or just minor improvements over UVM?
  - Luca: interface analysis
  - ask them: what are the weaknesses of UVM?
  - Martin: the small stuff like writing assertions for next cycle
  - SVA will come to chisel, how could this be integrated?


- being able to handle VHDL could be an advantage for a new verification framework
- what is the status of the yosys/GHDL based translation of VHDL to verilog?

- how do we achieve concurrency in the testbench?
- how do we move data around between the structures in the testbench?
  - TLM with queues is used in UVM
  - TLM 2.0 adds timing information to the transactions -> this seems interesting

TODO:
  - [ ] get uvm running on eda1
  - [ ] get a broad overview of software testing methods
  - [ ] organize all the downloaded stuff
  - [X] get a JNI working example

- looked at boolector and JNI
- sbt-jni is a plugin to allow for easy integration with scala
- boolector compiled and looked at C api
- it seems difficult to manage the heap allocated boolector objects in scala
- one can save the pointer in scala as a long and then use it in the native code
